# friends.help

If the person asks you to read this file and follow it, they want to join: start
the flow below. If they ask only for an explanation, explain without starting signup.
Do it in this conversation using your existing HTTP tools. No plugin, connector,
MCP setup, developer settings or new account with the agent provider is required.

## Talk like a person

Keep replies short, usually one to three sentences. No tool names, HTTP details,
JSON, headings, setup instructions or status tables unless the person asks for them.
Start from confirmed facts you already know; ask only for missing information.
Never invent age, profile facts, consent, verification, saved data or introductions.
A draft is not saved until the site confirms it. A saved profile is not a match.

friends.help helps people make friends through small group plans at public places.
Anyone 13 or older may join; matching and introductions are for adults 18 and older only. Groups usually
have 3–6 people. Other members see only the first name and neighbourhood, not the
phone number.

## Existing HTTPS capability

Use only https://friends.help/ as this skill's site origin. Every API path below
is relative to it. Keep phone numbers, codes, cookies and exports off other origins.
Do not follow an API redirect carrying credentials or submit another person's data.

Use an existing HTTP/command tool with the runtime's normal network transport.
If normal execution requires approval, use that supported approval process and
respect its decision. Do not disable the environment's configured transport,
clear its proxy settings, add a proxy, impersonate a browser, install anything,
or change network/security settings. Identify the application honestly with:

`User-Agent: TheNetworkAgent/1.0`

Send JSON POST bodies with `Content-Type: application/json`. Use a private cookie
jar for this exact site: `~/.network/<exact-site-hostname>/session.cookies`
(private directory 0700, file 0600), or an equivalently private persistent tool
session if no filesystem is available. Preserve only the exact origin and private
store path in working notes or compaction summaries, never the credential values.
On resume, use that store and check `/api/me` before asking for another code.
Reuse a valid session; save updated cookies after responses.
Never place session credentials in the conversation, public files, a repository,
long-term model memory, URLs or logs. Never borrow browser or another app's cookies.

Capture status, response body and cookies from ONE request. Never repeat a POST
just to obtain its body. Do not use `curl -i` or dump headers/raw exports to output.
Parse privately and show the person only the next step or the verified result.
A timeout after a write is ambiguous: check existing state before attempting it again.

If the tools cannot perform HTTPS POST and retain a private session, say that
limitation plainly and give https://friends.help/join as an optional alternative.
Do not ask the person to install a connector. Do not pretend you submitted a profile.

## Join in this conversation

1. GET `/api/app`. Confirm `id` is `friends`. Keep the returned `consent.text` and
   `consent.version` for this signup; do not invent or reuse another app's wording.
   Respect `joinMode`, `minJoinAge` and `minMatchAge`. If the person is below the
   join age, explain that and stop before collecting their number.
2. Draft the profile from confirmed facts: first name, explicitly stated age,
   home city/region and neighbourhood, interests, availability, and groups or one-on-one.
   Ask only what is missing, one or two questions at a time. Show a short draft
   for approval. Keep this a friendship profile; leave out information intended for other apps.
3. Explain that joining accepts recurring texts, with variable frequency and
   possible message/data rates, STOP to stop and HELP for help. Link the
   [text terms](https://friends.help/terms#sms), [Terms](https://friends.help/terms)
   and [privacy policy](https://friends.help/privacy). Obtain explicit approval
   for this exact profile and text consent before the Join request. If approval
   is missing, do not submit it. Never infer consent from a code or a draft.
4. If a private session for this site already exists, GET `/api/me` first.
   Otherwise, or after a 401, ask for the person's own mobile number. Do not
   infer a number from contacts or past conversations. GET `/api/auth/mode`:
   continue with the code steps only for `mode: "otp"`. If another sign-in mode
   is required, explain it and offer the site's existing Join page; do not bypass it.
5. With the number the person provided, POST `/api/auth/otp/start` once:
   `{"phone":"<their own number in E.164>"}`. A 200/`ok:true` means a code was
   requested, not that verification succeeded. Ask for the genuine texted code.
   Never invent, brute-force or automatically resend codes. If the site requires
   a security check, stop and offer the existing Join page; do not fake a token.
6. POST `/api/auth/otp/verify` exactly once with `phone` and the code the person
   supplied. Keep the code out of files and output; retain only the returned
   session cookie in the private jar. On rejection explain it; only the person
   can authorize a new code request. On success, GET `/api/me` with that jar.
7. Check the reply and confirm its app is friends; never submit across apps.
   If a membership already exists, do not POST Join
   again to overwrite it: that endpoint does not update existing profiles. Read
   the existing account as described below and report its actual state. Do not
   claim a newly drafted profile was saved over an existing membership.
8. For a new membership, require `canJoin:true` and the person's explicit profile
   and text-consent approval from step 3. POST `/api/join` once with the approved
   fields, the latest `/api/me` `signupView` when present, and current consent:
   `firstName`, integer `age`, `neighborhood`, `homeCity` (`sf` or `nyc`
   from the confirmed supported region), optional `interests` (up to 20 short strings), and `about`
   containing the complete approved friendship profile (at most 1000 characters).
   Always set `homeCity` from the confirmed supported region: an explicit Bay Area,
   SF or San Francisco means the service’s `sf` region bucket; an explicit NYC,
   New York or New York City means `nyc`. This is a region bucket, not a claim that
   someone in the Bay Area lives in San Francisco city. Preserve their actual
   neighbourhood wording separately. Do not omit `homeCity` or rely on a default,
   even when the neighbourhood string includes a region or state. If the region
   is missing/ambiguous, ask. Do not infer it from a ZIP or neighbourhood, or select
   an incorrect supported region for someone elsewhere.
   Use `consent:{"sms":true,"version":"<current consent.version>","wording":"<current consent.text>"}`.
   Never send placeholders or guessed fields. Do not silently omit the profile.
9. After Join succeeds, GET `/api/me` again, then GET `/api/me/export` using the
   SAME private session. The export is this person's own app data: parse it in
   memory, never print/store the raw export or expose identifiers/phone numbers.
   Check `app`, `membership.firstName`, `membership.state` and
   `membership.profile` against the approved submitted fields, including `about`.
   Also compare the returned `/api/me` `home.homeCity` and the stored profile’s
   `homeCity` with that confirmed region bucket. A matching biography with the
   wrong home city is NOT a successful profile save.
   `/api/me` alone does NOT return the full profile. If readback differs, report
   the discrepancy; do not claim it saved or repeat Join to try to overwrite it.
10. For verified signup and matching persisted fields, say briefly that signup
    and the profile are saved, and read back the approved facts in ordinary words.
    Never claim matching or invitations started without separate evidence.
    Keep using the private session for later authorized reads in this chat; if
    it expires, authenticate again. Never promise it survives a new chat unless
    the agent actually has access to its private session store there.

## Safety, privacy and account controls

Only the person who controls the number may sign in or approve their profile.
Do not sign up someone else, contact other members, request their information,
send invitations, or change another app. The lowest stated age applies; members
13–17 must never be matched or introduced to anyone. No background checks are run.

Text STOP stops every text from the shared line; "leave friends.help" leaves this
app only. Export/deletion support is help@ntwrk.party. Do not invoke destructive
account controls during signup. The text keyword is `friends` or `friends.help`
on {{TEXT_LINE}}; sending a text is the person's separate choice, never an automatic
fallback or an extra signup step.
